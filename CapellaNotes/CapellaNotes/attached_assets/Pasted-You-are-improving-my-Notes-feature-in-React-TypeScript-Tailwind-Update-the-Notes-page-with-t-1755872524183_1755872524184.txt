You are improving my Notes feature in React + TypeScript + Tailwind.  
Update the Notes page with the following changes:

1. **Top Bar UI Enhancements**
   - Keep the glass effect but decrease the neon glow around the notes editor so it looks premium and subtle, not too strong.
   - Each button should still have a glass effect (`backdrop-blur-md bg-white/10 hover:bg-white/20 border border-white/20 shadow`).
   - Arrange buttons logically: [Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough] → [Bullet list, Number list, Checklist, Headings] → [Undo, Redo] → [Search bar] → [AI Assist dropdown].

2. **AI Assist Info**
   - On the AI Assist button in the top bar, add an "Info" option.
   - Clicking it should open a centered glass-effect modal box that explains all AI features (Summarize, Rewrite, Expand, Translate, Smart Tagging) and how to use them.
   - The info box should have a dark glass background (`bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-lg border border-white/20`) and white text. Do not use any emojis.

3. **Search Bar**
   - Fix search functionality so typing filters and highlights matching text.
   - Add a **light teal animated outline** around the search input. The outline should softly move/glow around the shape.

4. **Notes Page Header**
   - Replace "Start writing your note..." with `"Your Note"`.
   - On the same line, show **tags**:
     - Header text aligned left.
     - Tags aligned right.

5. **Tags Functionality**
   - Users can add tags for each note.
   - Tags should be saved with the note and searchable.
   - Tags should also appear on saved notes at the top.
   - Each tag should be displayed as a glassmorphic pill button with different light colors (light blue, light pink, light green, etc.).

6. **Search by Tags**
   - The search bar should also allow searching notes by tags.
   - If the query matches a tag, all notes with that tag should be displayed.

7. **Editor Scrolling**
   - Allow smooth scrolling inside the editor with `overflow-y-auto` and `scrollbar-none`.
   - No visible scrollbars in the UI.

8. **Data**
   - Remove any dummy/pre-saved notes. Start with an empty editor.

Ensure styles remain consistent with Tailwind, keep everything modern, glassy, and premium-looking.
